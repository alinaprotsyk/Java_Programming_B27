    Q: What is the difference between instance and static members
       Instance belongs to the object and there can be as many copies as there are objects
       Static belongs to a Class and there is only one copy of it

Q: How does the static block work
       Static block executes first whenever we load the Class, and it only runs one time
       Used to set static variables

Q: How does the constructor work
        Constructor is used to initialize instance variables and is used when we create objects

Q: What are the possible static members
        Variable, Method, Block, Class
