    /*
    - constructor is used mainly to initialize our instance variables

- when an object is created, the constructor is automatically called.
    - it is called in relation to new operator

- the instance variable is called outside the constructor/method , while local is called inside the constructor/method.

- used to tell the compiler the difference between a local variable and an instance variable

    /*
    Q: What does a constructor do?
=>Constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize instance variable. If not custom created, compiler will create one using default values.

Q: When is the constructor called?
=>The constructor is called when we make an object of the class.

Q: What is the difference of a local variable and instance variable
=>local variable: local to the code block only
=>instance variable: variable that is defined in a class, not belonging to any other code block

Q: What is this keyword used for
=>this: acts as a reference to the object. (guides compiler to the instance variable)
